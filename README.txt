  FOREWORD
  --------
   ___
    |
   _|_ originally created this engine out of a sense of preservation. GM8-based
  engines and games were rotting and obsolete when I learned of this community,
  and the making of Guy Remastered was a painful process where we slowly
  refurbished a 9-year-old GM8 engine up to spec. I wasn't satisfied with the
  state of Studio engines either, and greatly due to Studio's own problems, the
  general programming workflow felt far removed from that simplicity of opening
  Game Maker and getting to work in a matter of seconds.

    And so, using Guy Remastered as a base, I decided to create a unified GM8
  project that would satisfy my own standards for what an engine should aim to
  do for its user - just enough so that you don't need to spend so much time
  fiddling with the internals to get things to cooperate, but also not so much
  that it overwhelms you. Several people have joined my endeavours over time,
  and I'm thankful for their contributions to this project.
  
    Making a game should be a creative process, not a laborious one.
  
    I dedicate this engine to my good friend Natsu, who's been running his game
  ideas through me since we met in 2012, and my good friend Floogle, who drives
  me to complete great things. Great times were had and will continue to be.

  damn i added some like 3 lines of code and now apparently i'm part of the
  engine? crazy how that works out
  
  on a more real note, i'm very grateful for renex for making such a fantastic
  engine, and i'm proud to be able to contribute to it as much as i did

  i hope that you all can make and continue making good use of it in the
  future too
